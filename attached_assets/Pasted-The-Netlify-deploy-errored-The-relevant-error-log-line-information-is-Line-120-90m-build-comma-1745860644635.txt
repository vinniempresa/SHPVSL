Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

### Diagnosis:
The build failed due to secrets scanning detecting secrets in the build output or repository files.

### Solution:
To resolve this issue, you need to remove the detected secret values from the specified files in the build output (`dist/public/assets/...`) or from the repository files. Ensure the secret values are not exposed in your build output.

If these secrets are expected and necessary for your application, you can use `SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS`, `SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS`, or `SECRETS_SCAN_ENABLED` to prevent the scanning tool from detecting them. For more information on secrets scanning and how to configure it, refer to the [Netlify Docs on secrets scanning](https://ntl.fyi/configure-secrets-scanning).
